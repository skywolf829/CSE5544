STEPS TO REPRODUCE IMAGES

In Unity Editor:
    If using the Unity editor, first open the project by navigating to 
    /Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity and double clicking on it. This should open Unity.
    Once open, click the play button at the top and be sure you 
    can see your "Game" window. 

If using build executable:
    Unzip the file "HW1_SkylarWurster_Mac.zip" if on Mac, and 
    the file "HW1_SkylarWurster_Windows.zip" if on PC. Locate the .app or .exe file
    within the unzipped folder and double click that. Adjust the resolution and
    graphics settings to your liking.


INSTUCTIONS WHILE RUNNING
    After running the visualization, you will see 6 buttons on the right. Two are
    for selecting the mesh shown for each data point - cube or sphere. Select one
    you would like. The other 4 buttons switch between each of the 4 visualizations.
    To navigate in the scene, hold down shift while pressing WSAD to move forward, 
    backward, left, and right, respectively. Similarly, Q and E will make you move
    downward and upward, respectively. While holding shift still, moving the mouse 
    will cause the camera to rotate.


NOTES:
    -Best viewed in at least 1920x1080 for UI concerns.
    -Cubes typically will cause less lag than spheres in the program
    -Click "Reset" to send all data points back to their initialized state
